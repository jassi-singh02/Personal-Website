              I love watching films and I have a letterboxd that I keep updated. I enjoy taking pictures as well, and would love to start making video projects as well.
              I enjoy writing and reading books, I will make a goodreads soon, but know I try my best to be cultured. I love Russian literature, so feel free to talk about anything Russian.

            <h1> My College Essay</h1>
            <p>
              If you take a look at my desk and PC, you would swear that I am an obsessive nerd with a strange affinity for lists. On my browser’s bookmarks bar, there is a collection of categorized folders jam-packed with links leading to content to indulge. This is where I keep my lists of albums to listen to, movies to watch, art to see, books to read, and so on. Each submission to those lists receives a proper five minutes of research. This is all part of a mindset that I like to call vicarious living. Vicarious, being defined as “lived in the imagination of the experience of others”, is a word that defines my approach to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Music, a medium of audio, is one part of that vicarious experience. On Saturday afternoons, I look forward to sitting at my desk with my PC turned on, Spotify opened, and headphones ready. This is where I get to curate playlists and appreciate the music I am listening to. It’s where I get to explore over 10 different ways to experience sadness, whether that be Joy Division’s exploration of rock bottom through grimy, bare post-punk, or Wilco’s bittersweet lamentation through their fusion of alt-rock and country. Not only do I get to understand my emotions in a deeper sense, but I get to explore new feelings through music. Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, a towering piece of music, instills a feeling of humanity and brotherhood that I didn’t know I carried. Imagination allows me to make connections and thoughts with the music I listen to, creating new feelings and moods to discover.
            </p>
            <p>
              Movies, a medium with audio and visuals, give a different form of vicarious experience. My imagination revels over the scenes, settings, and images film provides. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, human evolution and space exploration are depicted through Kubrick’s excellent pairing of grandiose music and sleek visuals. Scenes of early man developing tools and modern humans gliding among the stars in elegant, gargantuan spaceships are stored in my mind giving me a sense of human transcendence. In Taxi Driver, I can see through the perspective of a social outcast in the character Travis Bickle. I vicariously experience the pitfalls of loneliness and viewpoints of cynicism. With this, I start to understand my feelings and learn where to move away from this moral descent. By thoughtfully viewing film, I gain a different perspective to view reality and a deeper understanding of myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Literature, a medium of just words, gives another form of vicarious experience in how it communicates ideas and thoughts. Over my quarantine period, I got to read the book 1984, an acclaimed classic, in my free time. 1984 paints a gut-wrenching image of the dangers of totalitarianism and the pitfalls of censorship. Through this book, I picked up on a subtle, but important idea Orwell communicates. In this book, the ruling government reduces the number of words in each subsequent dictionary edition. The implication that arises from this is that language dictates thought; there are certain thoughts that we can’t think of because we don’t have the words for them. This sparked a realization that changed my approach to life. The music that we listen to, the films that we watch, the people that we talk to, the places that we go, and the content that we consume forms our sense of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Possibilities of who I can be and my sense of reality are expanded by what I expose myself to and choose to analyze. The world is too vast for our minds to comprehend; there are a multitude of perspectives to understand and an infinite number of topics to explore. With higher education and the age of the Internet, I have a wide, easy-to-access range of possibilities to explore. My overall approach to life, supplemented by vicarious living, gives me a fuller sense of reality and a step towards self-actualization.
