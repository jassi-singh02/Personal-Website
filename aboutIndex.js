    title: "My College Essay",
    content: [
      "If you take a look at my desk and PC, you would swear that I am an obsessive nerd with a strange affinity for lists. On my browser's bookmarks bar, there is a collection of categorized folders jam-packed with links leading to content to indulge. This is where I keep my lists of albums to listen to, movies to watch, art to see, books to read, and so on. Each submission to those lists receives a proper five minutes of research. This is all part of a mindset that I like to call vicarious living. Vicarious, being defined as \"lived in the imagination of the experience of others\", is a word that defines my approach to life.",
      "Music, a medium of audio, is one part of that vicarious experience. On Saturday afternoons, I look forward to sitting at my desk with my PC turned on, Spotify opened, and headphones ready. This is where I get to curate playlists and appreciate the music I am listening to. It's where I get to explore over 10 different ways to experience sadness, whether that be Joy Division's exploration of rock bottom through grimy, bare post-punk, or Wilco's bittersweet lamentation through their fusion of alt-rock and country. Not only do I get to understand my emotions in a deeper sense, but I get to explore new feelings through music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony, a towering piece of music, instills a feeling of humanity and brotherhood that I didn't know I carried. Imagination allows me to make connections and thoughts with the music I listen to, creating new feelings and moods to discover.",
      "Movies, a medium with audio and visuals, give a different form of vicarious experience. My imagination revels over the scenes, settings, and images film provides. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, human evolution and space exploration are depicted through Kubrick's excellent pairing of grandiose music and sleek visuals. Scenes of early man developing tools and modern humans gliding among the stars in elegant, gargantuan spaceships are stored in my mind giving me a sense of human transcendence. In Taxi Driver, I can see through the perspective of a social outcast in the character Travis Bickle. I vicariously experience the pitfalls of loneliness and viewpoints of cynicism. With this, I start to understand my feelings and learn where to move away from this moral descent. By thoughtfully viewing film, I gain a different perspective to view reality and a deeper understanding of myself.",
      "Literature, a medium of just words, gives another form of vicarious experience in how it communicates ideas and thoughts. Over my quarantine period, I got to read the book 1984, an acclaimed classic, in my free time. 1984 paints a gut-wrenching image of the dangers of totalitarianism and the pitfalls of censorship. Through this book, I picked up on a subtle, but important idea Orwell communicates. In this book, the ruling government reduces the number of words in each subsequent dictionary edition. The implication that arises from this is that language dictates thought; there are certain thoughts that we can't think of because we don't have the words for them. This sparked a realization that changed my approach to life. The music that we listen to, the films that we watch, the people that we talk to, the places that we go, and the content that we consume forms our sense of reality.",
      "Possibilities of who I can be and my sense of reality are expanded by what I expose myself to and choose to analyze. The world is too vast for our minds to comprehend; there are a multitude of perspectives to understand and an infinite number of topics to explore. With higher education and the age of the Internet, I have a wide, easy-to-access range of possibilities to explore. My overall approach to life, supplemented by vicarious living, gives me a fuller sense of reality and a step towards self-actualization."

    title: "Convocation Speech 2021",
    content: [
      "It’ll be quite some time before we can truly grasp and understand the whirlwind that this pandemic year has taken us through. I tried looking through past yearbooks to find some semblance to our times, but nothing could truly compare. I have realized that the distinction of this Darrow school year from others is not the mere fact that we’re living in the midst of a pandemic, but the fact that we had so little control throughout the year. The situation evolved on a day-to-day basis and nothing had absolute certainty. We were and are condemned to the eternal present, which suddenly felt both excruciatingly mundane and nerve-racking in its peril.",
      "Twentieth century writer Albert Camus’s idea of Absurdism can be used as a lens to analyze and reflect on our times. The absurd is the contradiction between humanity's innate desire to seek meaning coupled with the cold, unanswering nature of the universe. Philosophers came to two conclusions to deal with this realization: either take a leap of faith in believing in a higher power to give our lives meaning, or believe that our lives are inherently meaningless in a meaningless universe. Albert Camus offered a different solution, Absurdism, which is the belief that one should lucidly accept the absurd, but simultaneously rebel against it by embracing what life has to offer. The absurd in our case is the mismatch of our ordered, stable lives with the unpredictable, uncaring nature of the coronavirus pandemic." , 
      "The year started with both caution and optimism for what we could accomplish in the  near future. The festivities of September and early October seemed to foretell a possible easing to restrictions and masks. However, as time constantly showed, these hopes were dashed by the exponential rise of cases, which forced us to extend our virtual staymester and cut back the length of the school year. We tried placing our hopes on a “normal” second semester and an elaborate Spring Term, but again these hopes were spoiled as the year went along. The bitter reality for many students, especially seniors, is the fact that this year will be nothing like any other year. In many ways, it will feel like a wasted year without the common joys shared in traditions like Friday Morning Meetings, seasonal concerts, and “normal” activities.",
      "However, this realization alone wasn’t enough to bring down the collective spirit and tenacity of the Darrow community. We understood the ever-complex and dangerous situation at hand but didn’t resign ourselves to the fact. Our act of rebellion against the pandemic was not the act of blind faith to enjoy a “normal” year, but rather the measured response to both keep lives safe and to maximize the joy of each passing moment. We were still committed to each other despite the unbearable stress the pandemic inflicted upon us. The collective efforts of our faculty, students, and staff allowed us to make the most out of this year without any outbreaks of COVID-19 on campus. This was the immeasurable effort put in by faculty and staff to both create and execute a plan for this school year. This was the exuberance shown time and time again at morning meetings, even in a virtual setting. This was the immense sacrifice made by the community to forgo physical and emotional comforts to keep the campus free of COVID-19. This was the persistence of everyone who believed in humanity.",
      "The hope that one day we’ll all someday return to “normal” wasn’t what motivated us, as that only served to diminish our spirits with every missed expectation. It was the recognition that we lived in an eternal present that both gave us the freedom to be the most that we can be and to act with common decency to minimize suffering and protect each other. We accept and acknowledge the tragic fate of this year, but with that comes an acceptance of ourselves and our capabilities. This acceptance alone allows us to find genuine happiness in our experience. This is the moral victory that the Darrow community carries from this pandemic year and one that we should continue even when the world becomes “normal” again."

    title: "7000+ Miles",
    content: [
      "7000+ miles in three months. Long solo road trips to Niagara Falls, Bar Harbour, ME, Concord, NH, and many more places. All of this (+ help ofc) to escape my nearly constant intense suicidal thoughts, deep feelings of emptiness, despair, and anxiety, past traumas, and issues back at home. Here is what I learned:",
      "Jean Paul Sartre writes about the idea of bad faith, the act of denying our inherent freedom yielding to external pressures and adopting false values to forgo the uncomfortable task of choosing one’s fate. I unconsciously practiced this most of my life. I tried to fit in with the expectations that my family and society placed on me to find the “right” path that aligned with my interests. No matter what I did, I couldn’t help but feel that there was a more rewarding, respectable path that others were on. This caused me intense angst everytime I switched what I pursued or even my everyday actions such as sharing this on a platform meant to show the best parts of my life or acting if I am busy working all the time as an inspirational high achieving Williams student.",
      "Out of all the sources of help I reached out to, my love for the people that were there for me was the only thing that saved my life, not God or simply “thuggin it out”. Victor E. Frankl wrote “Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality…. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized... By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.” For so long, I imagined love and intimacy to only come in the form of romance. With how society portrays marriage, the toxic culture men have with the idea of friendship and vulnerability, and my upbringing, I was convinced that loneliness was an inherent feeling. I put up barriers from people truly getting to know me afraid of the feeling of vulnerability. It took me an uncomfortably close distance from suicide to realize that I could find true love and genuine connection with the friends there for me."
